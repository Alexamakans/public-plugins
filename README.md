# Lucid Plugins

This fork of Lucid Plugins are plugins made for the Devious API (see info below) and are either plugins made by
me or were outdated plugins that I ported and updated.
I am currently working on maintaining an updated version of each of my plugins to support both the Devious Client API (https://github.com/jbx5/devious-client)
and the EthanVann API (also referred to as RLPL/Runelite Hijack https://github.com/Ethan-Vann/EthanVannPlugins).

**If a plugin is not originally by me it will not have "Lucid" in the plugin name**

Current Plugin List:
- Private Plugins: (Paid with Source Code Included along with compiled plugin jar after purchase)
  - Lucid Gauntlet - It's like Gauntlet Extended but includes auto features like auto-prayer/wep switching at Hunllef to make
    the Hunllef fight nothing but having to dodge tornados and tiles. Makes getting combat achievements a piece of cake.
    - and more! (Note: This is NOT a full auto plugin, but does include some auto features)
  - Lucid ToA - All the benefits of ToA extended with tons of helper features added in:
    - Auto-prayers (All pray-able bosses have auto prayers)
    - Auto-dodge (most dodge-able attacks have auto-dodge options)
    - 1-click Crondis Water Container
    - Auto Zebak wave skip
    - Hotkey Yellow Keris Spec
    - and more! (Note: This is NOT a full auto plugin that will do the whole raid for you, more like "semi-auto")
- Public Plugins: (Free with Source Code Open Sourced a.k.a plugins in this repository)
  - Gauntlet Extended (originally by xKyle, updated to work past recent update)
  - Lucid Cannon Reloader - Reloads your cannon for you. Customizable.
  - Lucid Custom Prayers - Extremely powerful and customizable prayer helper plugin. Allows you to auto-pray most PvM
    encounters using various events. Comes with debug option for easy set-up.
  - Lucid Disable Rendering - Disables rendering to reduce CPU usage and mimics minimal mode while allowing multiple plugins to run. Toggleable.
  - Lucid Gear Swapper - Set up gear swaps that can be customized with a hotkey or via a weapon equip trigger. Includes easy set-up via gear import button in config.
  - Lucid Muspah (Still in Development, overlay is working) - Overlay for stepback method + auto-stepback
  - Lucid Spices - Auto-fights hellrat behemoths for spices and keeps your cat alive during the fight. Makes getting spices for
    stews painless without risking your cat dying (I totally have no experience with this happening, I swear)
  - Lucid Discord Logger - Lets you send any received game, public, private, clan, or group messages to a Discord hook for easy logging. Has customizable override webhook URLs available for each type.
