# Lucid Plugins
Lucid Plugins are plugins made for Devious Client and are either plugins made by
me or were outdated plugins that I ported and updated to Devious. 

**If a plugin is not originally by me it will have the original owner in the
plugin description.**

# Lucid Gauntlet
Adapted and updated from xKylee's original "Gauntlet Extended" plugin,
with added automated features during the Hunllef fight:
- Auto offensive prayer switching (Eagle eye, rigour, mystic might, etc)
- Auto defensive prayer switching (Protect from missiles, magic, melee)
- Auto weapon switching (will switch to the next weapon after 6 hits)
- Automated options also support the ranged 5:1 method (you just need *at least* a t1 of each weapon)
